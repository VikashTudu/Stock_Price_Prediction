List:-
eg

list = []

List methods in python:-

https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_list.asp

append()- here we put the element(one) in the argument (paranthesis), adds element to the end of the list.
index() - here we put the element(one) in the argument, 
insert() - it takes two arguments (index, element), puts the element at the given index.
pop() - here we give index as the argument, it returns the element in that index
remove() - here we put the element that is needed to be removed.
-------
Tuple:-

tuple = ()

https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp

tuple are ordered and unchangeable and allow duplicate values
ordered means item will remain as it is as they were intially put unlike sets

therefore you only access tuple element using index
eg:- tuple = ("apple", "banana")
     tuple[1]  
     # output
     #"banana" 
------

Set:-

set = {}

https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp

it is unordered, unchangeble, unindexed 
and does not allow duplicate value


------

Dictionary:-

dic = {"key" :"value"}
key can be a integer, string or set
list and set can't be the key.

insert the element in dictionary.
dic["key2"] = "value2"

Fuction

def func_name(argument1, argument2,...):
	#some operation

e.g. 
def sum(a,b):
	print(a+b)
	#output sum of the two numbers
